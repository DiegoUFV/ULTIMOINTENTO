                <h2>FUNDAMENTALS OF COMPUTER ENGINEERING</h2>

                <div>
                    "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in
                    both
                    academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals
                    on which
                    this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional
                    careers and the
                    Page 1
                    role of a computer engineer in today's society.
                    The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the
                    second helps
                    develop practical skills.
                    The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content.
                    <p></p>
                    <ol>
                    <li> Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future
                    of Computer
                    Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor:
                    anthropological
                    and ethical foundations.</li>
                    <li> Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of information.</li>
                    <li>Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends
                    in
                    computer systems and applications.</li>
                </ol>
                <p></p>
                    The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an
                    introduction to web
                    development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on
                    contents related
                    to the course.
                    <p></p>
                    Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the
                    development
                    basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills,
                    both oral and
                    written, of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in
                    the educational
                    project of the University.
                    <p></p>
                    The course "Foundations of Computer Engineering" is meticulously crafted to offer a holistic
                    perspective of
                    Computer Engineering, encompassing its academic and professional dimensions. The main objective of
                    this course
                    is to acquaint students with the fundamental principles that underpin the discipline, including
                    mathematical,
                    physical, anthropological, and ethical foundations. Moreover, it aims to familiarize them with the
                    diverse career
                    opportunities available and the pivotal role assumed by computer engineers in contemporary society.
                    <p></p>
                    This course is structured into two distinct modules. The initial module delves into theoretical
                    foundations and
                    encompasses three pivotal content blocks:
                    <p></p>
                    <ol>

                    <li>The first block critically examines the intersection of Computer Engineering and Society, exploring
                    its historical
                    antecedents, contextualizing its present state, and contemplating its future trajectory. Moreover,
                    it elucidates
                    Computer Engineering as an academic discipline and profession, and delves into the profound human
                    aspects
                    such as anthropological and ethical foundations.</li>
                    
                    <li>The second block focuses on the fundamental principles of Computer Engineering, aiming to comprehend
                    the
                    inner workings of computers and identify their key components.</li>
                    
                    <li>Finally, the last block revolves around Data management, processing, and communication. It not only
                    elucidates the fundamental concepts but also explores current paradigms and emerging trends in
                    systems and
                    applications.</li>
                    </ol>
                    The second module of the course is dedicated to fostering practical skills. Herein, workshops play a
                    pivotal role,
                    fostering teamwork, the production of well-crafted printed documentation, and the delivery of
                    impactful oral
                    presentations to diverse audiences. Significantly, the laboratories provide an invaluable
                    opportunity for students to
                    gain hands-on experience in web development by embarking on a project centered around the creation
                    of a web
                    page exploring topics relevant to the subject.
                    <p></p>
                    In addition to the cultivation of technical competencies, this course espouses the development of
                    essential skills
                    requisite for future engineers. It emphasizes the significance of teamwork, ethical commitment, and
                    effective
                    communication skills, both oral and written, particularly in the technical domain. By embracing
                    these overarching
                    goals, this course aims to nurture well-rounded engineers who embody the comprehensive educational
                    vision
                    outlined in the university's educational project.
