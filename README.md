DIFFICULTIES
The main struggles I had when doing this website was the amount of time it required me and by attempting to use a template I had to re-arrange all the links, deactivate a lot more and reorganize many times the main structure myself to make it look better. I also attempted 3 different templates till the last one finally worked.
